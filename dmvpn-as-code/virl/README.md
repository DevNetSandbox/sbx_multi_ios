# VIRL topologies

We are using VIRL to model our network topologies for the purposes of development,
testing, etc.

This directory contains various topologies, and environments required to accomplish
that in this project

# Launching a topology

We recommend using [virlutils](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virlutils) to launch

```
cd test
virl up
```
