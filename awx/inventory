# Use a local distribution build container image for building the AWX package
# This is helpful if you don't want to bother installing the build-time dependencies as
# it is taken care of already.
# NOTE: IMPORTANT: If you are running a mininshift install, using this container might not work
#                  if you are using certain drivers like KVM where the source tree can't be mapped
#                  into the build container.
#                  Thus this setting must be set to False which will trigger a local build. To view the
#                  typical dependencies that you might need to install see:
