Welcome to Cisco NetDevops Sandbox Labs!  You've done well finding us here, and we have a lot in store for you.

This repository is meant to be paired up with Cisco DevNet's `Multi-IOS Cisco Test Network` sandbox.  This sandbox is essentially VIRL + Devbox (a linux box preinstalled with great tools)

This repositories folders contain content to build an environment to help you learn, and even contains lab guides you see here.

If you want to run these labs on a local VIRL server, you can do that too!

Since these are using a generic Devnet Sandbox, we will need to build up the sandbox to suite our needs.  You will notice that each lab has its own setup instructions, so we consolidated the lab setup notes [here](sandbox-setup/).
